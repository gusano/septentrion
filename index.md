        <b>Septentrion</b> is a performance project involving psychoacoustics, dance, singing, clown 
        work and improvisation.<br />
        Developed in 2013 by <a href="http://yvanvolochine.com" target="_blank">Yvan Volochine</a> 
        as research on the subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Septentrion</b> performances, or actions, can be seen as physical tests as well as 
        multi-sensorial experiences, putting the audience in heavy emotional states, from stress 
        to delight.<br />
        Music and sounds also play an important role in the performances. All musical pieces are 
        written or recorded by Yvan Volochine. When needed, self-made controllers, sensors and 
        micro-computer are used.<br />
        Actions can be driven by the location history and culture, but not necesarily, as they 
        mostly are the result from an intensive work on improvisation, breathing and energy.

        Audience discretion is advised.
